## 📝 Description

## About Buzz-Women

Founded in 2012, Buzz Women equips women from low-incomes backgrounds with financial, entrepreneurial, and leadership skills to
overcome poverty and drive prosperity for their families and communities.
The nonprofit sends volunteers to remote villages to deliver training programs in financial management, entrepreneurship, and
leadership. They make knowledge and opportunities available at their doorstep. So far, Buzz Women has trained 300,000 women with
100s of volunteers. About 190,000 women have come out of moneylender’s trap in rural areas, and about 40,000 new businesses have
been started by the women who were trained by Buzz Women volunteers.

The ultimate aim is to bring the knowledge, skills, tools, and opportunities to women. Once they have the right skillsets, they will find the
solutions for their problems. And these solutions will be sustainable than any other solution brought to them by outsiders, including the
nonprofit.

To help Buzz-women in their amazing work we have made a chat-bot which will help women to take their decisions and transform their lives from poverty to prosperity, from self-pity to self-confidence, from fear to courage.
